Racial Composition Across Census Tracts
Overall Demographics (2020 Census): NYC’s population is approximately 8.8 million, with 30.9% Non-Hispanic White, 28.3% Hispanic or Latino, 20.2% Black or African American, 15.6% Asian, and 3.4% multiracial. Smaller groups include 0.2% Native American and 0.07% Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander.
Geographic Distribution:
White Population: Predominantly concentrated in northwest areas, such as parts of Manhattan (e.g., Upper East Side, ZIP code 10021) and northwest Brooklyn. Non-Hispanic Whites make up 43.74% of the non-Hispanic population citywide.
Hispanic Population: Most prevalent in northeast areas, particularly in the Bronx, Queens, and parts of Brooklyn. Hispanics are the largest ethnic group in Manhattan, with Dominicans being the most significant Hispanic subgroup.
Black Population: Concentrated in parts of Brooklyn, the Bronx, and southeast Queens. The Black population has declined in Brooklyn, Queens, and Manhattan but increased in the Bronx and Staten Island between 2010 and 2020.
Asian Population: Heavily concentrated in Queens, which hosts the largest Asian American population in the U.S., and parts of Brooklyn and Manhattan (e.g., Chinatown areas). The Asian population grew across all boroughs from 2010 to 2020.
Multiracial and Other Races: Multiracial individuals (3.4%) are spread throughout the city, with higher diversity in Queens, which has some of the most diverse census tracts in the U.S. (diversity index ≥ 82.0%).
Diversity: Queens County stands out for its high racial and ethnic diversity, with census tracts showing significant Hispanic, Asian, and multiracial populations. The diversity index for the U.S. in 2020 was 61.1%, but some Queens tracts exceed 82.0%, indicating a high probability of two randomly selected individuals being from different racial or ethnic groups.
Income Across Census Tracts
Citywide Median Income (2023): The median household income in NYC is $79,713, up 4.05% from $76,607 in 2022. However, income varies dramatically by census tract.
High-Income Tracts:
Manhattan, particularly the Upper East Side (e.g., Census Tract 21), has some of the highest median incomes, with tracts reaching $250,001 or more. In 2005, Manhattan had the highest-income census tract in the U.S. ($188,697) and the lowest ($9,320), highlighting extreme inequality.
High-income areas often correlate with higher proportions of Non-Hispanic White residents and are driven by wage growth in top income brackets. For example, Manhattan’s average weekly wage in 2006 was $1,453, the highest among large U.S. counties.
Low-Income Tracts:
Areas with higher proportions of Black and Hispanic residents, such as parts of the Bronx and southeast Brooklyn, often have lower median incomes. The Bronx has the second-lowest county life expectancy in New York State (78.3 years), tied to lower incomes and socioeconomic challenges.
In 2023, 17.4% of NYC’s population (1.45 million people) lived below the poverty line, higher than the national average of 12.4%. The largest groups in poverty are Hispanic, followed by Black and White residents, with females aged 25–34 most affected.
Income Disparities:
Income inequality is pronounced, with Manhattan showing the greatest variation. The top 1% of earners in high-income brackets have seen rapid wage growth, while middle and lower-income brackets have stagnated.
Census tracts with higher incomes often have better access to healthcare, education, and housing, contributing to longer life expectancies (e.g., some Bronx tracts with higher incomes have life expectancies above the state average).
Key Patterns and Observations
Segregation and Diversity: Despite NYC’s overall diversity, many census tracts remain racially and economically segregated. For example, wealthier, predominantly White tracts in Manhattan contrast with lower-income, predominantly Hispanic and Black tracts in the Bronx and Brooklyn.
Economic and Social Factors: Income disparities are linked to race, education, and occupation. Tracts with higher White and Asian populations often have higher incomes and homeownership rates (citywide homeownership is 32.8%, compared to the national 65%).
Data Limitations: Some census data may be distorted for privacy (e.g., at the block level), and older data (e.g., 2005–2009 ACS estimates) may not fully reflect current trends. Always cross-reference with recent sources like the 2019–2023 ACS for accuracy.
